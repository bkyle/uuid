This program is a simple command line wrapper for Python's UUID module.  It's
purpose is to allow you to quickly generate and manipulate UUIDs.

uuid can be invoked as follows:

$ uuid         # Generate a single UUID and output as dashed hex
$ uuid -n10    # Generate 10 UUIDs and output as dashed hex
$ uuid -n-     # Generate UUIDs until the program is stopped
$ uuid -i      # Generate a single UUID and output as an integer
$ uuid -b      # Generate a single UUID and output as hex (no dashes)
$ uuid -f-     # Read UUIDs from stdin and output them (useful when combined 
               # with -b or -i)
$ uuid -f file # Read UUIDs from file and output them
