This program is a simple command line wrapper for Python's UUID module.  It's
purpose is to allow for the faster generation of UUIDs.

uuid can be invoked as follows:

$ uuid      # Generate a single UUID and output as dashed hex
$ uuid -n10 # Generate 10 UUIDs and output as dashed hex
$ uuid -i   # Generate a single UUID and output as an integer
$ uuid -b   # Generate a single UUID and output as hex (no dashes)
